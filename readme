Yes, using shared memory properly would increase performance. 
The way to do it is: 
The visited vector (X) should be placed inside the shared memory, becuse for each neighbour in Ea vector we will have to check if the vertex has been accessed. 
The frontier (F) being called from the GPU kernal should be placed in global memory, because it only have to be accessed 2 times (1 for check if F[threadID] == true and 2 for F[threadId] = false)
The cost (C) should be placed within global memeory because the cost only get updated once the whole time. 
Ea vector should be placed within shared memory if the graph is condensed, while not necessary if the graph if sparce enough. 
Va need not to use the shared memory because it only has to be accessed 2 consecutive elements per time, and global memory access uses two cache lines but fast enough. 


1.2 
It would be good to use reduction methods to calculate the sum of the F vector, and check if the sum is 0. If the F is all false, then the sum should be 0. 

1.3
keep a queue of fromtier vector F and check if the queue is empty after each iteration. Or use a flag to indicate if the queue is empty after the iteration.
